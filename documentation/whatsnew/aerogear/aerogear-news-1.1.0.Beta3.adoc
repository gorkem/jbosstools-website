=== Restore Cordova plugins during import

When importing a Cordova project, if the project already references a list of plugins on its _config.xml_ 
file, they are restored to the project during import. Also, _config.xml_ is always updated during plugin 
installation and removal. This causes the plugins installed via *registry* to be always restorable hence  
eliminates the need to put them on source control if preffered.

See http://www.gorkem-ercan.com/2014/06/sharing-cordova-projects-becomes-easier.html[Gorkem's post] for
a demo of the feature.
